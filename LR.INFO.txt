*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*                            The Loadrunner virus*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*Info/disassembly/extraction by Derek Young, 1991 - The Digital Youth AllianceI'm uploading this file on September 29, two days before October begins...  Asyou may or may not know, October is the month when the Loadrunner virus willshow up!  Don't worry though.  This virus is basically harmless.  It eitherdisplays an interesting message on the screen or it will erase itself fromthe disk.First of all, you should probably check your disks now to see if they'reinfected with the virus before it goes off when you don't want it to. Photonix II, ZZCopy, and Deverminator will all check a disk for viruses and erase them if found.If you're curios to see what the "interesting message" looks like withoutrisking your disks to see it, run Loadrunner.demo.  I extracted this part ofthe virus and placed it into a seperate file.  Don't worry, it won't hurtanything - it's just interesting to watch.  When you're through watching it, just press control-reset and the program will quite to whatever it was launchedfrom. __________________|                  || LOADRUNNER FACTS ||__________________|Here are some little know items of interest about the virus:- you cannot remove the virus from the computer by doing a reboot - you need to  do a cold start by turning the computer off and on again or running the self-  test.- if the loadrunner virus is in your system and you boot up on a even numbered  day while the minute is divisible by eight, loadrunner will change your  border color.  It used to be believed that this was a "bug" of the virus  but it's just a little clue that something is wrong.- One more thing I've never heard before - you can ask loadrunner if it's in  your computer by holding down the option key when you restart your computer.  If it's there, it will display a number on the screen - the number of times  it has infected others disks!
